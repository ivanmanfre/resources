  "project_title": "Order Routing Automation",
  "date": "July 18, 2025",
  "primary_problem": "Manual order fulfillment requires 3 people touching every order across ShipStation, Shopify, and their 3PL portal, taking 15 minutes per order across 80-100 daily orders, creating bottlenecks and an 8% error rate.",
  "hours_wasted": "20-25",
  "desired_outcome": "Fully automated order routing from Shopify to the correct 3PL based on product type and shipping zone, with tracking sync, customer notifications, and exception flagging  -  enabling same-day fulfillment and scaling to 500+ orders/day without additional staff.",

  "current_tools": "Shopify, ShipStation, Klaviyo, 3PL portal",
  "trigger_description": "A new order is placed in Shopify, firing a webhook to kick off the automation.",
  "process_description": "The automation evaluates the order's product type and shipping zone, routes it to the correct 3PL via API, syncs the tracking number back to Shopify, triggers a shipping notification in Klaviyo, and flags any exceptions for manual review with error handling and retry logic.",
  "output_description": "Orders are automatically routed to the correct 3PL, tracking numbers are synced to Shopify, and exception reports are generated for manual review.",
